# Localized Containerized Web App

This repository contains the source code for a simple web application with a frontend and a backend.

The application is currently not working as intended. Your task is to get it running using Docker and Docker Compose, and then to automate the process with a script.

You should consider this repository a starting point for your work. Good luck!
